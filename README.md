# SUPERSTORE-PROFIT-ANALYSIS

Superstore, a commercial enterprise with over 500 branches spread across 4 regions,49 states and  531 cities in the United States of America is experiencing a major decline in sales in a number of cities  which have affected the overall revenue generated and is seeking for insights on the drop - down in sales and recommendations to implement to generate more sales and profit for the growth of the business in the various cities
# APPROACH
I collected the superstore data from an online source (kaggle) and proceeded to access the data to properly understand the statistics and mode of operations of the superstore company and deduced that the profit margin is higher in some cities and quite low in some other cities so I decided to make a profit analysis to review this profit margin, draw insights and profer solutions to the cause of poor sales.
I sought to answer some questions which are:
-Bottom 10 cities generating the lowest profit
- Top 10 cities generating the highest profit
-Products (category) with the most sales
-Profit variation by segment
-Sales frequency by regions
-Products with the most profit

Having ascertained the issues to deal with,I proceeded to clean the data ensuring there were no duplicates or outliers which may impugn the validity of the data via Microsoft Excel after which I created  a dashboard in Power BI to represent the results visually

# RECOMMENDATIONS
•	TO INCREASE SALES, MORE INCENTIVES SHOULD BE CREATED IN  CITIES MAKING THE LEAST SALES AND GENERATING THE LEAST PROFIT LIKE 
LANCASTER,HOUSTON,BURLINGTON AND OTHERS. INCENTIVES LIKE A BONUS OR REWARD OF A FREE GIFT IF A PURCHASE IS MADE
•	UPSELLING THE PRODUCTS IN REGIONS LIKE THE WEST AND CITIES LIKE LAFAYETTE WITH A BOOM IN SALES IN ORDER TO RAISE MORE PROFIT.
•	OFFICE SUPPLIES ARE APPARENTLY IN HIGH DEMAND, THERE SHOULD BE CONSTANT AVAILABILITY OF SUCH TO INCREASE SALES
•	ADVERT PLACEMENTS IN CITIES DOING POORLY IN SALES IS A MUST TO PROMOTE AWARENESS OF THE SUPERSTORE AND INCREASE SALES
